## Project Workflow

1. **Start with Planning**
   - Use `/plan` or `/spec` to define requirements
   - Edit `docs/transcript.md` with vision and requirements

2. **Create Execution Plan**
   - Use `/execution-plan` for detailed steps
   - Or `/build` to analyze and create plan automatically

3. **Execute with Agents**
   - Use `/execute` to run your plan
   - Agents automatically reference this claude.md
   - Use `/resolve_todo_parallel` for parallel execution

4. **Track Progress**
   - Use `/todo` to organize tasks
   - Use `/todo-done` to archive completed work

5. **Deliver & Document**
   - Use `/changelog` for release notes
   - Use `/deploy-docs` for documentation

- **docs/backend.md** - Auto-generated by `/build`
- **docs/todo.md** - Your execution plan
- **claude.md** - This file; reference for all resources

## Tips for Success

1. **Use the Right Command** - Check the planning section for the right starting command
2. **Delegate Effectively** - Read agent descriptions to pick the right specialist
3. **Document Everything** - Keep docs/transcript.md updated
4. **Iterate Quickly** - Use `/resolve_todo_parallel` to execute in parallel
